Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It was designed with the principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), meaning that Java code can run on any device that supports Java without needing to be recompiled.

### Features of Java

- **Platform Independence:** Java programs can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.
- **Object-Oriented:** Java follows the object-oriented programming paradigm, allowing for the creation of reusable...

### Interview Questions
1. What were the issues that were fixed with the new Date and Time api of Java 8?
   The new Date and Time API introduced in Java 8, found in the java.time package, addressed several issues present in the older date and time APIs (java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar). Here are the key issues that were fixed:

Immutability and Thread-Safety:
   Old API Issue: The Date and Calendar classes are mutable, meaning their instances can be changed, leading to potential thread-safety issues in multi-threaded environments.
New API Solution: The new API provides immutable classes such as LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime, and Instant. Once an instance is created, it cannot be modified, making the new API inherently thread-safe.

Poor API Design:
   Old API Issue: The Date and Calendar classes have several design flaws, such as starting months from 0 (January) rather than 1, inconsistent method naming, and a mix of date and time manipulation methods.
New API Solution: The new API offers a more consistent and fluent design, with clear separation between date and time (LocalDate for date, LocalTime for time, etc.), making the API easier to understand and use.

Lack of Clarity and Precision:
   Old API Issue: The Date class combines both date and time information, leading to confusion and lack of precision when only date or only time is required. Additionally, Date has no direct support for time zones.
New API Solution: The new API introduces separate classes for different use cases: LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, and ZonedDateTime for handling date and time with time zone information. Instant is used for machine-readable timestamps.

Handling Time Zones:
Old API Issue: Time zone handling in Calendar is cumbersome and error-prone.
   New API Solution: The new API provides the ZoneId and ZonedDateTime classes, making it easier to work with time zones. It also supports extensive time zone rules and conversions.

Type Safety:
Old API Issue: The Date and Calendar classes often require the use of integers to represent months, days, etc., leading to potential errors.
   New API Solution: The new API uses well-defined types for date and time components, reducing the risk of errors. For example, Month is an enum type representing months.

Formatting and Parsing:
Old API Issue: Formatting and parsing dates using SimpleDateFormat is not thread-safe and requires careful handling.
   New API Solution: The new API introduces DateTimeFormatter, which is immutable and thread-safe. It also provides a comprehensive set of pre-defined formatters and support for custom patterns.

Human Readable Durations and Periods:
   Old API Issue: There is no straightforward way to represent and manipulate periods (like "2 years, 3 months, and 5 days") or durations (like "3 hours, 45 minutes").
New API Solution: The new API introduces Period for date-based values (years, months, days) and Duration for time-based values (hours, minutes, seconds), simplifying the manipulation of these values.
Overall, the new Date and Time API in Java 8 addresses numerous shortcomings of the old API, providing a more robust, readable, and maintainable framework for date and time operations.
